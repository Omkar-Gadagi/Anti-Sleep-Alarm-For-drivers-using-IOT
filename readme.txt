This project is an Anti-Sleep Alarm System designed to detect drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques. The system utilizes dlib's face detector and facial landmark predictor to identify key facial landmarks, particularly around the eyes. By calculating the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR), the system can monitor the driver's eye closure and detect signs of drowsiness. If the EAR drops below a certain threshold for a consecutive number of frames, the system triggers an alarm to alert the driver. This implementation uses OpenCV for video capture and display, and numpy for numerical computations. The project is particularly useful for enhancing driver safety by providing real-time drowsiness detection and alerting capabilities.
